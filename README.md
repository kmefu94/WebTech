Integration of a small project to incorporate php, javascript, and other web technologies


A1 consists of a simple log-in function which prompts the user for a name. The information is sent to the server and if it does not match the specified credentials then they are redirected using PHP, javascript and HTML.

A2 consists of a user inputting a string which gets sent the the server through PHP. The PHP then formats the string to return the amount of certain characters or formatting which can be changed by request of the user.
